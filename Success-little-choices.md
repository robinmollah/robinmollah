## Our very little choices brings success
If we have to choose between study abroad and study in country, we need to do a lot of brainstorm to understand which one will be better.
The same issue happens when someone gets chance to get admit into several nearly competiting colleges.   
From my perspective, I think when we are in a situation where we need to pick between "nearly competitive" options, we waste a lot of energy thinking about which one is better.
We have to understand we are lucky to have multiple options, people don't always get multiple options. Then we have to understand that it is complex to choose
because they have pros and cons or very little difference.So both options are almost equally good, this is the reason we are facing trouble to pick one of them.
So this is how we make an important decision at best way.   



**But important parts doesn't determine our future**   
Our day to day decision making determines what we are going to become. We don't prioritise those little decisions, but they matters most. There is a term,
"Opportunity Cost" very popular in economics. Everything costs something and we are always paying something to gain something. Right now, I can watch movies, play games,
code, read novels, gossip with friends etc. But I chose to write this doc.   
Whether I will go to gossip with friends or code, whether I will watch movies or read, these tiny decisions makes our life productive and brings success.
