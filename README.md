## Details about my journey on Computer

Here is a detail overview of my journey in computer science field. I just put those down here, I don't know if those will come in any help or not. But you may find a lot of interesting points related to your interest.

### Experiences not so available
* I spent a lot of time working with Android devices. I have extensive knowledge about the Android operating system. I used several root devices, customized those in various ways. Everything you see in your Android device is customizable, ie. Boot logo(default: company logo), Notification bar style, customised lock system(KnockLock), Toast notifications. Besides, I have extensive knowledge in reverse engineering of Android apps, including looking for security holes(network level and data storing level). I had worked with Android app development and its security systems from version *Jellybean* to *Marshmallow*
* J2ME was the most popular operating system before Android OS. I worked on reverse engineering of J2ME apps.
* I have extensive knowledge on developing websites on minimum available resources. I deployed a LUA web service to customize the existing control panel on a TP-LINK basic router with so low available resource. I can make large projects using Pure PHP, NodeJS, Python for lowest consumption of hardware resources. On the other hand, I can work with frameworks like Laravel, Django, Express for rapid development.
* Security system of web [COMING SOON]
* Game Development
  * LibGdx:
  * Unity:
  * CocosCreator:
  * Unreal Enginer:
* I have exceptional knowledge on Windows and Linux operating system(cloud too). I can write bash, cmd and PowerShell script for automating tasks. I have experience on working with rarely used but powerful tools. You never know what lengthy task I am going to automate and lift off a heavy part of your cost. Maybe you never imagined that's possible.
* Finally, as I have mastered on most popular technology stacks and tools, I can suggest you a solution from thousands of possibilities that will best fit your expectation.
