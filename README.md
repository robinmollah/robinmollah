### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Over the last 8 years, I honed my skill in a broad field of technology, worked individually and with team around the world. I have deep understanding of almost all mostly used, powerful and popular OS, tools, languages. And this is the reason I can provide you a solution from thousands of possible solutions exactly the one that will best fit your requirements.

If you are not interested to read in detail about my expertise [**JUMP**](#work-experience) **to get a short overview**


## Details about my journey on Computer

Here is a detail overview of my journey in computer science field. I just put those down here, I don't know if those will come in any help or not. But you may find a lot of interesting points related to your interest.

### Experiences not so available
* I spent a lot of time working with Android devices. I have extensive knowledge about the Android operating system. I used several root devices, customized those in various ways. Everything you see in your Android device is customizable, ie. Boot logo(default: company logo), Notification bar style, customised lock system(KnockLock), Toast notifications. Besides, I have extensive knowledge in reverse engineering of Android apps, including looking for security holes(network level and data storing level). I had worked with Android app development and its security systems from version *Jellybean* to *Marshmallow*
* J2ME was the most popular operating system before Android OS. I worked on reverse engineering of J2ME apps.
* I have extensive knowledge on developing websites on minimum available resources. I deployed a LUA web service to customize the existing control panel on a TP-LINK basic router with so low available resource. I can make large projects using Pure PHP, NodeJS, Python for lowest consumption of hardware resources. On the other hand, I can work with frameworks like Laravel, Django, Express for rapid development.
* Security system of web [COMING SOON]
* Game Development
  * LibGdx: This is a java graphics framework. I developed a first person shooting game([1971 : Hit & Run](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.properbd.hitnrun)) using this framework. I learned a lot about efficient programming and memory optimisation during development of this game. I made optimisation in every possible level of the game to make the frame rate over 40FPS on mid-range devices. Writting efficient codes, making a good architecture, dereferencing properly for java garbage collector, reusing graphics assets like, images. compressing files json and other raw files etc.
  * Unity: After low-level understanding of how graphics framework works, it took very little time to learn unity. I found a lot of components are built-in and ready to use. I don't need to worry about the architecture.
  * CocosCreator: Typescript based game engine. I developed this simple game in CocosCreator. I don't recommend to use CocosCreator
  * Unreal Enginer: I worked with ViewTek and The Seagull Company as a contract based employee. They offer high value simulation softwares based on UE4 and delivers to consumers by pixel-streaming service.
* I have exceptional knowledge on Windows and Linux operating system(cloud too). I can write bash, cmd and PowerShell script for automating tasks. I have experience on working with rarely used but powerful tools(regedit, disk management, complex symlinking etc). You never know what lengthy task I am going to automate and lift off a heavy part of your cost. Maybe you never imagined that's possible.
* Finally, as I have mastered on most popular technology stacks and tools, I can suggest you a solution from thousands of possibilities that will best fit your expectation.
